### About

> I help solve complex computational problems. Usually this involves developing novel techniques, algorithms and exploiting high-performance computing systems.

I am now a postdoc researcher at the University of Edinburgh. I am involved in the [VELaSSCo](http://velassco.atosresearch.eu/) project which provides new analysis methods for large-scale particle-based simulations.

Before that, I was a researcher on the [ORIGIN](http://www.origin-energy.eu) project, where I worked on parallelising and optimising a machine learning algorithm that learns and makes localised short-term weather predictions based on datasets from various sources.

Between 2011 and 2015 I was a [SICSA](http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/) PhD student in the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University. During my [PhD](http://www.ros.hw.ac.uk/handle/10399/2990) I investigated high-level parallel programming models, developed new parallelism control mechanisms, and applied those to scientific and numerical applications, including the N-body simulation and sparse matrix multiplication. An indispensable PhD resource is [this](http://phdcomics.com/).

### Research 
I have a broad research interest. Main topics include:

- Distributed and Parallel Computation, High-Performance Computing
- Parallel Algorithm and Data Structure Design
- Programming Languages, (Parallel) Functional Programming
- Applications: Scientific, Big Data and Machine Learning
