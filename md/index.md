### About

> *I help solve complex computational problems. Usually this involves using a number of methodologies including parallelisation, machine learning techniques, developing novel algorithms and exploiting high-performance computing systems.*

I currently work as a postdoc researcher in Big Data and high-performance computing on the [VELaSSCo](http://velassco.atosresearch.eu/) project at the University of Edinburgh. 

Before that, I was a researcher on the [ORIGIN](http://www.origin-energy.eu) project at Heriot-Watt University, where I worked on parallelising and optimising a machine learning algorithm that learns and makes localised short-term weather predictions from large datasets.

Between 2011 and 2015 I was a [SICSA](http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/) PhD student in the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University. During my [PhD](http://www.ros.hw.ac.uk/handle/10399/2990) I investigated high-level parallel programming models, developed new parallelism control mechanisms at a library-level, and applied those to scientific and numerical applications, including the N-body simulation and sparse matrix multiplication. An indispensable PhD resource is [this](http://phdcomics.com/).

### Research 
My main research interests include:

- Distributed and Parallel Computation, High-Performance Computing
- Parallel Algorithm and Data Structure Design
- Programming Languages, (Parallel) Functional Programming
- Big Data, Scientific/Numerical Applications, Machine Learning
