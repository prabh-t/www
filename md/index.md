### About

> I help solve complex computational problems by developing new algorithms and exploiting high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

I am now a postdoc researcher in HPC at the University of Edinburgh. I am involved in the [VELaSSCo](http://velassco.atosresearch.eu/) project which provides new visual analysis methods for large-scale particle-based simulations.

Before that, I was a researcher on the [ORIGIN](http://www.origin-energy.eu) project, where I worked on machine learning algorithm optimisation for weather forecasting.

Between 2011 and 2015 I was a [SICSA](http://www.sicsa.ac.uk/) PhD student in the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University. During my PhD I investigated high-level parallel programming models, developed new parallelism control mechanisms, and applied those to scientific and numerical applications, including the N-body simulation and sparse matrix multiplication. The thesis abstract can be found [here](phd-thesis/). If you are a PhD, you should find [this](http://phdcomics.com/) resource equally important.

I am an associate fellow of the UK Higher Education Academy (HEA) and a STEM ambassador.
